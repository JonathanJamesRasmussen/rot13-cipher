# ROT13 Decipher Algorithm
## Description
This algorithm will take in a string of any length (all uppercase) and then either encode it using an ROT13 cipher, which is a specific case of a Caesar cipher, or decipher an already ROT13 encoded string.

## Instructions
After copying the JavaScript function into your environment, call the function - `rot13('ENCODE THIS')`.  This cipher will only work on capitalized letters, so make sure that whatever you want encoded is capitalized.
